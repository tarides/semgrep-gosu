      Add parser for subset of gosu
      
      Adds enough rules to parse the following simple program:
      ```
      var hello = "Hello, World!"
      print(hello)
      ```
      
      The tree-sitter grammer is based on the EBNF notation at
      https://gosu-lang.github.io/grammar.html. The translation is fairly
      mechanical however it's not simple 1:1 mapping because precedece
      sometimes needs to be specified to avoid ambiguity in the grammar, and
      tree-sitter does not permit rules which would match the empty string
      however the grammar's original definition includes such rules.
